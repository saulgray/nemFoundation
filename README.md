Grav is a **Fast**, **Simple**, and **Flexible**, file-based Web-platform.  There is **Zero** installation required.  Just extract the ZIP archive, and you are already up and running.  It follows similar principles to other flat-file CMS platforms, but has a different design philosophy than most. Grav comes with a powerful **Package Management System** to allow for simple installation and upgrading of plugins and themes, as well as simple updating of Grav itself.

# QuickStart

These are the options to get Grav:

### Downloading a Grav Package

You can download a **ready-built** package from the [Downloads page on https://getgrav.org](https://getgrav.org/downloads)

### With Composer

You can create a new project with the latest **stable** Grav release with the following command:

```
$ composer create-project getgrav/grav ~/webroot/grav
```

### From GitHub

1. Clone the Grav repository from [https://github.com/getgrav/grav]() to a folder in the webroot of your server, e.g. `~/webroot/grav`. Launch a **terminal** or **console** and navigate to the webroot folder:
   ```
   $ cd ~/webroot
   $ git clone https://github.com/getgrav/grav.git
   ```

2. Install the **plugin** and **theme dependencies** by using the [Grav CLI application](https://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-cli) `bin/grav`:
   ```
   $ cd ~/webroot/grav
   $ bin/grav install
   ```

Check out the [install procedures](https://learn.getgrav.org/basics/installation) for more information.

# Adding Functionality

You can download [plugins](https://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins) or [themes](https://getgrav.org/downloads/themes) manually from the appropriate tab on the [Downloads page on https://getgrav.org](https://getgrav.org/downloads), but the preferred solution is to use the [Grav Package Manager](https://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) or `GPM`:

```
$ bin/gpm index
```

This will display all the available plugins and then you can install one or more with:

```
$ bin/gpm install <plugin/theme>
```

# Updating

To update Grav you should use the [Grav Package Manager](https://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) or `GPM`:

```
$ bin/gpm selfupgrade
```

To update plugins and themes:

```
$ bin/gpm update
```
