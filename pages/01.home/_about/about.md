        heading: 'About NEM'
        body: 'The NEM network represents a new generation of blockchain software. Although it is often grouped with cryptocurrency networks, NEM was built with 100% original code on a ‘blue ocean’ approach, meaning it is a platform in which anyone can manage any data and build applications to suit their specific needs - getting more people outside the crypto currency domain to embrace its technology. It is designed to merge all the strengths of a blockchain and distributed ledger technology with infinitely expandable functionalities, and it currently does so better than any other network.'
